This repository demonstrates a common Objective-C bug related to memory management when bridging between ARC and Core Foundation objects. The `bug.m` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.m` provides the corrected version.  The error occurs due to improper use of the `__bridge` transfer, leading to crashes. The solution involves using `__bridge_transfer` to correctly handle object ownership.
