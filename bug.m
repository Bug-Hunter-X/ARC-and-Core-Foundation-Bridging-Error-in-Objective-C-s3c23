In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with the interaction between ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and Core Foundation objects.  Consider this scenario: 

```objectivec
CFStringRef cfString = CFStringCreateWithCString(kCFAllocatorDefault, "Hello, world!", kCFStringEncodingUTF8);
NSString *nsString = (__bridge NSString *)cfString;
// ... some operations with nsString ...
CFRelease(cfString);
```

The issue lies in the improper usage of `__bridge`. `__bridge` creates a unidirectional transfer of ownership.  After `CFRelease(cfString)`, the `CFStringRef` is deallocated, leaving `nsString` pointing to garbage.  Accessing `nsString` after this will lead to a crash.
